## 🧠 About Me

**Senior Product Manager | Senior Machine Learning Engineer | Senior Team Lead | AI Systems Architect**

I build and lead AI products and platforms that automate enterprise processes, reduce operational costs by millions, and elevate decision-making with LLMs and RAG. With 3+ years at Sberbank and Proscom, I turn business outcomes into scalable ML services — from discovery and PRDs to production microservices.

As a team lead and product owner, I’ve managed 5+ engineers, owned roadmaps and OKRs, established CI/CD, and delivered NLP-driven automation that saved **35M RUB/year** and improved model accuracy by **16%**. I’m focused on shipping usable, reliable AI in regulated environments and aligning cross‑functional stakeholders (HR, Compliance, Finance, IT).

Currently focused on:  
✅ Product strategy for AI assistants and internal automation  
✅ Experimentation & analytics: A/B tests, north‑star metrics, funnel insights  
✅ Hybrid LLM + RAG agents for enterprise knowledge bases  
✅ Scalable ETL pipelines with Kafka, Hadoop, NiFi  
✅ Productionizing LLMs (GigaChat, Qwen) with LangChain & FAISS  
✅ Kubernetes-based microservices architecture  
✅ Leading cross-functional ML teams
