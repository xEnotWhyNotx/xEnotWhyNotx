## 🧠 About Me

**Senior Machine Learning Engineer | AI Systems Architect | Team Lead**

I build and lead high-impact AI systems that automate enterprise processes, reduce operational costs by millions, and elevate decision-making with LLMs and RAG architectures. With 3+ years of experience at Sberbank and Proscom, I specialize in transforming business challenges into scalable ML solutions — from prototype to production-grade microservices.

As a team lead, I’ve managed 5+ engineers, established CI/CD pipelines, and delivered NLP-driven automation that saved **35M RUB/year** and boosted model accuracy by **16%**. I’m passionate about pushing the boundaries of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), MLOps, and responsible AI deployment in regulated environments.

Currently focused on:  
✅ Hybrid LLM + RAG agents for enterprise knowledge bases  
✅ Scalable ETL pipelines with Kafka, Hadoop, NiFi  
✅ Productionizing LLMs (GigaChat, Qwen) with LangChain & FAISS  
✅ Kubernetes-based microservices architecture  
✅ Leading cross-functional ML teams
